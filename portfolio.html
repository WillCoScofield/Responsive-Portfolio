        <p class="aboutPara">Although my name is Connor Scofield, my full name is Willam-Clayton Connor Scofield. I am an aspiring full stack
            web developer. I was born in Atlanta, GA and lived here until the end of high school. I moved to North Carolina
            to attend Elon University and graduated from Elon in may of 2017 after four amazing years of experiences</p>
        <p class="aboutPara">
            Most recently, I worked with the Atlanta Hawks as a Membership Associate. I worked with and managed a large clientle base
            of Atlanta Hawks Members, but since then have returned to working towards my main passion of becoming a web developer.
        </p>

        <p class="aboutPara">
            Currently, I am enrolled in the Ga Tech Full Stack Web Developer program and so far I have created this portfolio.
